# Google-Homepage

A simple replica of the google homepage using HTML and CSS.

This project is a simple introduction to learning HTML and CSS as recommended by the 
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home "The Odin Project").

Small changes to the original website to add a personal touch:

- All text uses Comic Neue (Comic Sans alternative) font.
- Google logo changes on hover.
- Hyperlinks send the user to a very interesting webpage.
